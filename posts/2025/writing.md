I have had many blogs over the years. This is one of them: [elisabethirgens.com/writing/](https://elisabethirgens.com/writing/) where I only ever managed 10 posts, the most recent from 2018 üôà and it is now a digital museum from a previous life.

In 2017, I set up a new blog in a more secluded corner and wrote in my initial [Hello world](https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/2017/06/hello-world/) post, that my goal was to ‚Äútry making more purposeful notes. I want to remind **future-me** about what **current-me** is learning, reading, watching, thinking.‚Äù The project was an experiment, and I decided that these notes did not need to be useful for anyone but me. 150 posts later, the experiment was a success. Most of all, I have managed to develop a writing habit that I actually enjoy.

I have been very inspired by Julia Evans‚Äô style of writing about computer things on the internet, and she has also posts about blogging that I cannot recommend enough:
