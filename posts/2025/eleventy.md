What’s the simplest approach to put words on a web site in 2025? As with all things; it depends! I really like using Eleventy, and maybe you will too. My favourite way of using Eleventy is _using as little of it as possible_. The [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) are all way too elaborate for my taste.

I have set up an example repo for the workshop, and it is stripped down to the core: <br>[github.com/elisabethirgens/booster-2025-blog](https://github.com/elisabethirgens/booster-2025-blog)

The workbook explains different approaches to set up your own blog, the most straight forward being how to download code from my repo and upload code to your repo. For anyone how wants to take the time for a hands-on approach to get to know more about how Eleventy works, you can use the git history and set up everything from scratch. Follow and reconstruct these first 6 commits step by step!

- Initial commit
- Ignore node_modules and build 🙈
- Set up dependency @11ty/eleventy 🎈
- Add index.html to verify hello world 👋
- Configure Eleventy and add template files
- Add a small dollop of vanilla CSS 🍦

We can check the [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com/stats/?url=https%3A%2F%2Felisabethirgens.github.io%2Fbooster-2025-blog%2F) and see the styles in total weigh in at 2KB and only contain 25 rules. The layout is responsive without a single media query. When writing _dollop_ in the commit message, I was ammused by finding definitions of the word meaning both a large amount and a small amount, so on a quest for meaningful commit messages, I landed on being specific: _a small dollop_ ✌️
